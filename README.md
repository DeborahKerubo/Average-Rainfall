# Average-Rainfall
Write a program that uses nested loops to collect data and calculate the average rainfall over a period of years. First the program should ask for the number of years. The outer loop will iterate once for each year. The inner loop will iterate 12 times, once for each month. Each iteration of the inner loop will ask the user for the inches of rainfall for that month. After all iterations, the program should display the number of months, the total rainfall for all months, and the average rainfall per month for the entire period.
Input should be validated using a loop as follows:
• Do not accept a number less than 1 for the number of years.
• Do not accept negative numbers for the monthly rainfall.
Additional Requirements:
• When prompting the user to enter rainfall values you should include the Year and Month currently being processed (for example: “Please enter rainfall for Year 1 Month 8: “).
• Output should be formatted to two decimal places.
• You should allow the user to continue to repeat the entire process as many times as they would like.
