# Average-Rainfall
This program uses nested loops to collect data and calculate the average rainfall over a period of years. First the program should ask for the number of years. The outer loop will iterate once for each year. The inner loop will iterates 12 times, once for each month. Each iteration of the inner loop  asks the user for the inches of rainfall for that month. After all iterations, the program displays the number of months, the total rainfall for all months, and the average rainfall per month for the entire period.
Input is validated using a loop as follows:
• Does not  accept a number less than 1 for the number of years.
• Does  not accept negative numbers for the monthly rainfall.
• Output is  formatted to two decimal places.
•  The user  is allowed to repeat the entire process as many times as they would like.
